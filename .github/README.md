## Why should I use this startpage?
Github has a lot of startpage repos. However, the vast majority of them are slow to load or require the internet (\*cough\* \*cough\* [Bento](https://github.com/migueravila/Bento)). Rather than use some framework or spin up a GitHub Pages server, why not just load a few files using very basic HTML/CSS/JS?

## Features
* Time of day message
* Custom theming (can also load themes depending on the time of day)
* Slap all of your bookmarks into a single js object
* Bookmark groups
* Keyboard shortcuts to each bookmark link (inspired by [tilde](https://github.com/xvvvyz/tilde))
* 100% garunteed to work with any screen/window size and not look broken.
* NO BLOATED FRAMEWORK!

## Advice
Install the used font and modify the html \<link\> in order to not need the internet for it to load nicely. Or, change the font to something you already have installed. ez
